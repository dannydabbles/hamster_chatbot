#  each line should only contain a word followed by its aggro value
#  separated by a space.

#  pair in the _aggroWords dictionary.
#  blank lines and lines beginning with '#' are ignored.
#  if a duplicate entry appears, the later entry will overwrite
#  the earlier one.
#  (+) positive values are anger words
