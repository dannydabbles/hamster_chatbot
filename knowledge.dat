hamsters are rodents belonging to the subfamily Cricetinae
the Cricetinae subfamily contains about 25 species, classified in six or seven genera
gamsters are crepuscular
in the wild, hamsters burrow underground in the daylight to avoid being caught by predators
hamsters' diet contains a variety of foods, including dried food, berries, nuts, fresh fruits and vegetables
in the wild hamsters will eat any wheat, nuts and small bits of fruit and vegetables that hamsters might find lying around on the ground, and will occasionally eat small insects such as small fruit flies, crickets, and meal worms
hamsters have elongated fur-lined pouches on both sides of hamsters' heads that extend to hamsters' shoulders, which hamsters stuff full of food to be stored, brought back to the colony or to be eaten later
the Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) was first described scientifically in 1839
it was not until 1930 that researchers were able to successfully breed and domesticate hamsters

pet Syrian hamsters are descended from hamsters first found and captured in Syria by zoologist Israel Aharoni
hamster behaviour can vary depending on their environment, genetics, and interaction with people
because they are easy to breed in captivity, hamsters are often used as animal testing|lab animals in more economically developed countries
hamsters have also become established as popular small house pets
the name ''hamster'' derives from the German ''Hamster'', which itself comes from earlier Old High German ''hamustro''
possibly related to Old Russian ''chomestru'', which is either a blend of the root of Russian language
Russian ''khomiak'' "hamster" and a Baltic word (cf. Lithuanian language|Lithuanian ''staras'' "hamster")
hamsters are stout-bodied, with tails shorter than body length, and have small furry ears, short stocky legs, and wide feet
their thick, silky fur, which can be long or short, can be black, gray, honey, white, brown, yellow, or red depending on the species, or a mix of any of those colors
two species of hamsters belonging to the genus Phodopus (Phodopus campbelli, Campbell's Dwarf Hamster, and Phodopus sungorus, the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster) and also two of the species of the genus Cricetulus, (Cricetulus barabensis, the Chinese Striped Hamster, and Cricetulus griseus, the Chinese Dwarf Hamster) have a dark stripe down the head to tail
the species of genus ''Phodopus'' are the smallest, with bodies 5.5 to 10.5cm (about 2 to 4 inches) long; the largest is the common hamster (''Cricetus cricetus''), measuring up to 34cm (about 13.5 inches) long, not including a short tail of up to 6cm (2-1/4 inches)
the Angora hamster, also known as the long-haired or Teddy Bear hamster, which is a type of the Syrian Hamster is the second largest hamster breed, measuring up to 18cm (about 7 inches) long
hamsters have poor eyesight; they are nearsighted and colorblind. However, they have an acute sense of smell and can hear extremely well
hamsters can use their sense of smell to detect gender, locate food, and detect pheremones. They are also particularly sensitive to high-pitched noises and can hear and communicate in the ultrasonic range
the tail is sometimes difficult to see; usually it is not very long (about 1/6th the length of their body) with exception of the Chinese dwarf hamster whose tail is the same length as the body
on a long haired hamster the tail is barely visible
hamsters are very flexible, and their bones are somewhat fragile
hamsters are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold
hamsters are hindgut fermenters and must eat their own feces in order to digest their food a second time
this practice is called coprophagy and is necessary for the hamster to obtain the proper nutrients from its food
hamsters are omnivorous
hamsters eat most things, and although they should regularly be given a diet of normal hamster food, it is enjoyable for both the owner and the hamster to experiment with other things, such as vegetables and fruits (though these should be removed once they go rotten or bad) seeds and nuts
the majority of pet-store food and treats for hamsters are not appropriate
one characteristic of rodents that is highly visible in hamsters is their sharp incisors
they have two pairs in the front of their mouths and these incisors never stop growing and thus must be regularly worn down
hamsters carry food in their spacious cheek pouches to their underground storage chambers
when full, their cheeks can make their heads double (or even triple) in size
hamsters in the Middle East have been known to hunt in packs to find insects for food
Syrian hamsters (''Mesocricetus auratus'') are generally solitary and may fight to the death if put together, whereas some of dwarf hamster species may get along with others of the same species
hamsters are primarily considered crepuscular because they live underground during most of the day, only leaving their burrows about an hour before sundown and then returning when it gets dark
at one point hamsters were considered nocturnal because they are active all night
some species have been observed to be more nocturnal than others
all hamsters are excellent diggers, constructing burrows with one or more entrances and with galleries that are connected to chambers for nesting, food storage, and other activities
hamsters will also appropriate tunnels made by other mammals; the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster (''Phodopus sungorus''), for instance, uses paths and burrows of the pika
although hamsters do not hibernate per se, they do -YÂ´close downÂ¡ a number of systems, such as breathing and heartbeat rate, for short periods of time. These periods of torpor can last up to seven to ten days
hamsters are known to stockpile large amounts of food where they sleep, making it possible to leave pet hamsters alone for a few days without food
hamsters become fertile at different ages depending on their species, but this can be from one month to three months of age
the femaleâ€™s reproductive life only lasts about 18 months, but male hamsters remain fertile much longer
females are in heat approximately every four days, indicated by a reddening of genital areas
hamsters are seasonal breeders. Breeding season is from April to October in the northern hemisphere, with two to five litters of 1 to 13 young being born after a gestation period of 16 to 23 days
gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian hamsters, 18 to 21 days for the Russian hamsters, 21 to 23 days for Chinese hamsters and 23 to 30 for Roborovski Hamsters
the average litter for Syrians is about 7, but can be as great as 24, which is the maximum number of pups that can be contained in the uterus
Campbell's Dwarf Hamsters tend to have 4 to 8 in a litter but can have up to 14
winter White Russian Dwarf Hamsters tend to have slightly smaller litters, as do Chinese and Roborovski hamsters
Siberian hamsters form close, monogamous bonds with their mates. If separated, they may become very depressed. This happens especially in males. Males will become inactive, eat more, and even show some behavioural changes similar to some types of depression in humans. This can even cause obesity in the hamster
Chinese hamster females are known for being aggressive toward the male if kept together for too long. In some cases, male Chinese hamsters can die after being attacked by the female. If breeding Chinese hamsters, it is recommended to separate the pair after mating or the hamsters will attack each other
golden hamster females are also very aggressive toward male hamsters and must be separated immediately after breeding in order to prevent an attack
female hamsters are also particularly sensitive to disturbances while giving birth and may even eat her own young if she thinks they are in danger, although sometimes she is just carrying the pups in her cheek pouches
hamsters are born hairless and blind in a nest that the mother will have prepared in advance. She uses shredded material such as leaves in the wild but prefers cotton or newspapers in captivity
after one week hamsters begin to explore outside the nest
hamsters are completely weaned after three weeks, or four for Roborovski Hamsters
most breeders will sell the hamsters to shops when the hamsters are anywhere from three to nine weeks old
Syrian hamsters typically live no more than two to three years in captivity, less than that in the wild
Russian Hamsters (Campbell's and Winter White) live approximately 1.5 to 2 years in captivity, and Chinese Hamsters 2.5 to 3 years
the smaller Roborovski Hamster often lives to 23 years in captivity
both Syrian and Russian hamsters mature quickly and can begin reproducing at a young age (45 weeks), whereas Chinese hamsters will usually begin reproducing at 23 months of age, and Roborovskis at 34 months of age
left to their own devices, hamsters will produce several litters a year with several pups in each litter
when seen from above, a sexually mature female hamster has a trim tail line; a male's tail line bulges on both sides. This might not be very visible in all species
male hamsters typically have very large testes in relation to their body size
before sexual maturity occurs at about 46 weeks, it is more difficult to determine a young hamster's sex
when examined, female hamsters have their anal and genital openings close together, whereas males have these two holes farther apart (the penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a hole or pink pimple)
it should also be noted that if a captive hamster is left for extended periods (34 weeks and more) with her litter, there is a high possibility that she will cannibalize the litter. It is therefore imperative that the litter be split up by the time the young can collect their own food and water
the best-known species of hamster is the Golden Hamster|Syrian or Golden Hamster (''Mesocricetus auratus''), which is the type of hamster most commonly kept as a pet. It is also sometimes called a "fancy" hamster
pet stores also have taken to calling them "honey bears", "panda bears", "black bears", "European black bears", "polar bears", "teddy bears", and "Dalmatian", depending on their coloration
there are also several variations of hamsters, including long-haired varieties that grow hair several centimeters long and often require special care
british zoologist Leonard Goodwin claimed that most hamsters kept in the United Kingdom were descended from the colony he introduced for medical research purposes during the Second World War
other hamsters that are kept as pets are the four species of "dwarf hamster"
Campbell's Dwarf Hamster (''Phodopus campbelli'') is the most common of the fourthey are also sometimes called "Russian Dwarfs"; however, many hamsters are from Russia, and so this ambiguous name does not distinguish them from other species appropriately
the coat of the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster (Phodopus sungorus) turns almost white during winter (when the hours of daylight decrease)
the Roborovski Hamster (''Phodopus roborovskii'') is extremely small and fast, making it difficult to keep as a pet
the Chinese Hamster (''Cricetulus griseus''), although not technically a true "dwarf hamster", is the only hamster with a prehensile tail (about 4cm long)most hamsters have very short, non-prehensile tails
many breeders also show their hamsters and so breed towards producing a good healthy show hamster with a view to keeping one or two themselves so quality and temperament are of vital importance when planning the breeding
although breeders of show hamsters specialise in breeding show hamsters, there are also owners who have bred their pet hamsters. These may be the result of a planned or unplanned pregnancy but the hamsters have usually been cared for well and handled regularly, so make very suitable pets
buying a hamster directly from a breeder means that there is the opportunity to see the parents and know the dates of birth
taxonomists generally disagree about the most appropriate placement of the subfamily Cricetinae within the superfamily Muroidea. Some place it in a family Cricetidae that also includes voles, lemmings, and New World rats and mice; others group all these into a large family called Muridae
